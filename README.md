DATA 211 Final

Out of all the regions, Africa is experiencing the highest rate of population growth and rapid urbanization.
However, with low income, there are not enough employment opportunities for the growing population, which is 
becoming a problem and leading to high and persistent unemployment rates. Educated people are forced to seek 
marginal employment, which traps them in poverty and is leading to overall economic and political instability 
across Africa. The goal of this project is to see the correlation between better labor market outcomes and 
living standards in mediating social conflict, comparing Africa with the rest of the world. We also want 
to show the changes in urbanization, employment, and conflict over time.
